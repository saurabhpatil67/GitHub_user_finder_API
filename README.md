# 🔍 GitHub User Finder

A simple and clean **GitHub User Finder** web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, which fetches user data and repositories directly from the **GitHub API**.  
This project helped me understand **API integration**, **async/await**, and **dynamic UI rendering** in JavaScript.  
I followed and learned this project from the **YouTube channel [Codesistency](https://www.youtube.com/@Codesistency)**.

## 🧾 Project Overview

The **GitHub User Finder** allows users to search any GitHub profile by typing a username.  
It shows detailed profile information like avatar, name, bio, location, followers, following, and the latest repositories.  
The repositories are displayed as cards that include stars, forks, language, and last updated date — all fetched dynamically using the **GitHub API**.
